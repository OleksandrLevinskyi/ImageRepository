# Image Repository

This is an ASP.NET Core 3.1 MVC image repository application.

Implemented:

SEARCH function
* from descriptions/names of the images

ADD image(s) to the repository
* private or public (permissions)
* secure uploading and stored images

DELETE image(s)
* Prevent a user deleting images from another user (access control)
* secure deletion of images

******************************************************************************************

Additional Functionality:
CREATE/READ/UPDATE/DELETE Albums for the registered users
* help users navigate though their images stored on the repository

RECOGNIZE THE DOMINANT COLOR for each image (possibly can be used to implement color-based search)

All CRUD functionality is implemented for BOTH Images/Albums.
Implemented all error handling for actions modifying the DB.
